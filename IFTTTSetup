Here are the instructions for setting up the two IFTTT recipes you need

***IF gmail THEN maker***
Choose your trigger and action (IF gmail THEN maker). Connect gmail to the account you want to use.
In the maker action settings, set the URL to the server URL. 
I'm sending POST requests with form data because there's something wonky about the json. 
The body should look like:
secret=<from-ifttt-secret>&sender=<sender>%date=<date>&subject=<subject> where sender, date, and subject are fields that IFTTT makes available.
Save the recipe. Now you should get requests at the URL you supplied when you get an email. 

***IF maker THEN gmail***
Choose your trigger and action (IF maker THEN gmail).
Choose an event name. This will go in your base URL for sending requests. 
Populate the email fields using value1, value2, and value3 (the values that you can send as json).
Save the recipe.
Grab your base url and key from ifttt.com/maker. 
Send your value1, value2, and value3 as json to the base URL + your key to trigger the gmail action.
